# Exactly What are We Learning Here?


The short answer:  the tech stack used by Code for BTV to build no-fuss mobile apps fast.

The shorter answer:  React Native, Expo & Firebase

If you're familiar with these things, you probably don't need this course.  If not, you'll probably find these answers unsatisfying.   So let's try to answer questions you will find helpful.
What is React Native?
React Native is a platform for building native mobile applications for Android and Apple phones.

What's a 'native mobile’ application?
A native mobile application is the kind of app you use on your phone every day.  You install from the app store and you start it by clicking an icon.  If it runs on an iPhone then It's likely written in Swift or Object-C.  If it runs on Android it's probably written in Java or maybe Kotlin.

There are other ways to build a mobile application.  We could build a mobile web app or even a progressive web app.  What's nice about web apps is that they run on any type of phone.  We don't have to learn Java and Swift and then build two apps.  We can use good ole JavaScript and build a single application.

Why don't we just build web apps?
Web apps run on web servers and our clients don't have the staff to manage servers.  We want to build apps, not babysit servers.

Okay, that's great but I still don't know what React Native is.
React Native is a development framework that allows writing native apps using JavaScript, HTML-like tags and CSS-esque styles.  Instead of building two apps in different languages, we can write an app in one language that runs on both operating systems. If you've built web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, React Native will look familiar.

So what's Expo?
Expo is a collection of development tools that make writing, building and debugging your React Native apps much, much easier.   With Expo, you can quickly run and debug your app right in your phone.  Expo also streamlines the build process so creating and deploying your final app is a whole lot less painful.

And Firebase? What about Firebase?
Your data has to go somewhere.  Firebase is a "serverless" data service brought to you by Google for storing and dishing up your data.  Firebase also has other cool features like authentication and analytics.


What's so special about this stack?
Code for BTV relies completely on volunteers to accomplish its mission of social and environmental justice.  We value our volunteers' time and respect the fact that our clients have limited expertise and meager budgets for server and software management.

The delivery of high-quality, low-cost, easy-to-maintain solutions quickly, is a key requirement for our clients and the retention of our volunteer staff.  Expo and Reactive Native allow us to iterate and code with ease while Firebase allows us to offload a lot of the server management to the fine folks at Google.
